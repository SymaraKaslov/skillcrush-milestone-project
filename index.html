							<h4>Jubilee Austen Project</h4>
							<h5>HTML5 & CSS Website</h5>
							<p>My first webpage coded from scatch using a Photoshop Design Comp; It was my first large project, and helped to reinfoce all of the css and html5 I had just learned. bBelieve it or not, the hardest part was not the code, but learning my way around that monster of a program called photoshop. My biggest take from this project was gaining an understanding of how relative links work. And this: </p>

							<h4>Holstee Manifesto</h4>
							<h5>HTML5 & CSS Exercise</h5>
							<p>my first coding project with Skillcrush, This exercise was a practice in learning how to think like a programer and break down a large problem into smaller parts using my newly aquired HTML5 AND CSS skills. I learned how to float elements and how to use clasess and ID's to style similar elements </p>

							<h4>Rogue Pickings Website</h4>
							<h5>HTML & CSS from Photoshop Design Comp</h5>
							<p>This project was also coded from scratch using a design comp. By the time I was done with Rogue I was able to "think inside the box" so much better; my understandng of the css box model and how padding/borders/margins work was solidified with the undertaking of this project </p>

					<h3>about me</h3>
					<p>My coding journey began in 2016. I was 28, living in Houston, and had recently quite my job as a flight attendant. One day I happened upon the "best places to work" addition of a  well know magazine in Houston. Close to the top of the list was a place called Poetic, a design and development firm. I navigated to their website and it was there that I first discovered code. One day, I decided that I was going to mozey on up to Poetic and ask them for a job without any prior coding experience. I did just that. Allthough I didnt get hired that day, they were nice enough to point me in the right direction: they sent me on my way with a referal to a coding boot camp in the area. I took up the mandate. Needless to say, boot camp was tuff, and I didnt make it past the first month. Depressed and defeated, I put down code. Over the next two years, I heard whispers from my inner being encouraging me to take up the mandate once more, but in attempt to protect myself from the pain of failure I resisted. However, time heals most wounds. I discovered skillcrush in 2018  and in a truly Symara fasion, I consulted the i ching (a 2000 year old oracle) on the matter. "im interested in taking the break into tech blueprint class at skill crush. It costs $1300 dollars."" I recieved the message "true and confident opening. regrets vanish". I decided to take the risk. </p>
